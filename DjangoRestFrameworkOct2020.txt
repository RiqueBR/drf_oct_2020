- Serialize model data
- examples of REST
- how we will write code together
- starting a DRF project

- writing pages to see the data

- GET and POST and CSRF

Rest Framework gives us...
- @api_view decorator
- APIView class
- Response class

Afternoon:
- review where we've got to...

The drf Response object now allows us to specify the format of the reponse
- accessing models in different formats 
- class-based views (and why we would use them)

Authentication
- adding users to our models (also serializer for users)
- (add some users to our app)
- delete and re-create the db so we can...
- work with API end-points that include users

End of course:
- feedback
- all my code available for download
